Relevant Experience:

  Software Engineer:
    Employer: Quantopian Inc.
    Dates: Oct 2018-present
    Location: Boston, MA
    Description: >-
      I work with a small team of exceptional software engineers, developing an
      open platform for financial research and collaboration via hosted Jupyter
      notebooks and an in-browser IDE. We missed the memo that sandboxing
      Python is an impossible problem, and are securely executing thousands of
      users' untrusted Python code on our servers, all while protecting their
      intellectual property by never even looking at their code.

      My personal responsibilities have included:
        - building high performance data engineering tools with Python and C++;
        - maintaining Docker-based development and deployment infrastructure;
        - managing complex scientific Python environments and build systems;
        - developing software as diverse as ETL pipelines and AST analyses;
        - converting not only our own code, but also thousands of users', from 
          Python 2 to 3 -- in the latter case, without ever looking at it.

      In addition to 'Software Engineer', I hold the self-bestowed title of 
      'Chief Emoji Officer', and am proudly responsible for fully **one third**
      (1/3) of our team's Slack emoji.

  Software Engineer 4:
    Employer: Adobe Systems
    Dates: Jan 2018-Oct 2018
    Location: Newton, MA
    Description:
      My first promotion! It's about the same as my previous role, just with
      more email.

      Developed and maintained the Send & Track service as part of Adobe's DC
      Web initiative. Worked primarily on the Django-based web server and
      daemons, coordinating with front-end focused teammates to ensure new API
      features were used appropriately and satisfied the problem's needs.

      Continued supporting the Custom Email Templates feature of Adobe Sign,
      helping CSMs to take full advantage of the new functionality and make
      sure customers were onboarded to their satisfaction. Diagnosed, triaged,
      and fixed customer- and CSM-reported errors in the service, working in
      both Python/Django and Java/Spring web projects.

      Played "goalie" for the Black Sparrow scrum team. Fielded all incoming
      external work requests, worked with the requesters to clarify and define
      the problems at hand, and made sure all necessary work was cataloged in
      the team's backlog. Became adept at politely-yet-firmly saying "no" :)

  Software Engineer 3:
    Employer: Adobe Systems
    Dates: Mar 2016-Jan 2018
    Location: Newton, MA
    Description: >-
      Developed the Custom Email Templates ("CEMT") feature of Adobe Sign with
      an amazing team of senior software engineers, the Black Sparrows.
      Designed and built from scratch a web service capable of managing
      user-editable templates and servicing 1 million email requests per day,
      with cross-region failover for 99.99% availability. Integrated the
      service with Adobe Sign, Adobe PostOffice, Amazon S3 and SQS, and our
      Identity Management Service.

      Interviewed and onboarded new team members, eventually partnering with
      one of them to bring a new component of the CEMT project to production,
      as the rest of the team was moved onto a new initiative.

      Saw my name used as a verb: in certain corners of the Newton office,
      "Fredericking" a Python question is now seen as a superior replacement
      for Google or Stack Overflow.

  Programming Mentor:
    Employer: Self-employed
    Dates: Oct 2015-Mar 2016
    Location: Cambridge, MA
    Description: >-
      In the words of Ned Batchelder, I "make people awesome". I love
      teaching, I love programming, and I love people: I've spent the
      last few months putting the three together and having an amazing
      time. My students have ranged from total beginners to experienced
      developers and business owners, and our projects have included web
      applications, video games, interactive art, and task queuing
      systems for production servers.

      (Disclaimer: Ned is not yet aware that I included his quip in my
      resume, and will probably roll his eyes at me once he finds out.)

      (Update: Yep.)

  System Reliability Engineer:
    Employer: Boston-area startup
    Dates: May 2015-Oct 2015
    Location: Cambridge, MA; Boston, MA
    Description:
      Spearheaded a reliability and quality-of-service initiative with
      the motto "Liberté! Qualité! Maintenabilité!". Integrated test
      automation and code coverage measurement into the build system,
      instructed colleagues in the art of unit and integration testing,
      and promoted a culture of bold, fearless, and clean-bug-backlog
      development.

      Developed end-to-end regression testing and business logic
      validation tools, used them to identify errors in customer-facing
      reports, and led the business logic team in a charge to eliminate
      all known bugs and give us a clean build. Integrated the tools
      with our build system to prevent regressions and new bugs, and
      later used their profiling output to identify and fix new code
      that had caused performance regressions.

      Delivered live biweekly presentations to the entire company on the
      System Reliability Team's efforts, and was frequently voted
      the company's most popular and effective technical presenter.

      Also wrote the company's official Python style guide.

  Chief Dev Lunch Officer:
    Employer: Boston-area startup
    Dates: Nov 2014-Oct 2015
    Location: Cambridge, MA; Boston, MA
    Description:
      Was honored to be nominated for this sacred and long-standing
      mantle after just a few weeks on the job. Responsibilities
      included organizing biweekly lunch meetings of the entire
      engineering team, finding relevant and fun technical topics to
      discuss, and coaching colleagues in group presentation-making.

      Leveraged the role to break down social barriers, encourage
      inter-team communication, and stimulate a culture of enthusiasm
      for learning.

  Software Engineer:
    Employer: Boston-area startup
    Dates: Oct 2014-Oct 2015
    Location: Cambridge, MA
    Description:
      Developed business analytics reports calculating metrics such as
      customer lifetime value, churn rate, and sales forecasting, and
      worked closely with product managers to develop a new set of
      reports for analyzing customer service response.

      Celebrated many code and query optimization achievements,
      including an 8x speedup on one report by eliminating redundant
      calculations.

  Software Developer:
    Employer: University of Oklahoma
    Dates: Jan 2014-Jun 2014
    Location: Norman, OK
    Description:
      Built Django-based web applications for internal use within

    Comment:
      Realized after three semesters that computer architecture was not
      at all what I wanted to pursue with my career. Took a semester off
      to see how I liked software development, and never looked back.
