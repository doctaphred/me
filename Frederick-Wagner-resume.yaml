Relevant Experience:

  Programming Mentor:
    Employer: Self-employed
    Dates: Oct 2015-present
    Location: Cambridge, MA
    Description: >-
      In the words of Ned Batchelder, I "make people awesome". I love
      teaching, I love programming, and I love people: I've spent the
      last few months putting the three together and having an amazing
      time. My students have ranged from total beginners to experienced
      developers and business owners, and our projects have included web
      applications, video games, interactive art, and task queuing
      systems for production servers.

      (Disclaimer: Ned is not yet aware that I included his quip in my
      resume, and will probably roll his eyes at me once he finds out.)

      (Update: Yep.)

  System Reliability Engineer:
    Employer: Boston-area startup
    Dates: May 2015-Oct 2015
    Location: Cambridge, MA; Boston, MA
    Description:
      Spearheaded a reliability and quality-of-service initiative with
      the motto "Liberté! Qualité! Maintenabilité!". Integrated test
      automation and code coverage measurement into the build system,
      instructed colleagues in the art of unit and integration testing,
      and promoted a culture of bold, fearless, and clean-bug-backlog
      development.

      Developed end-to-end regression testing and business logic
      validation tools, used them to identify errors in customer-facing
      reports, and led the business logic team in a charge to eliminate
      all known bugs and give us a clean build. Integrated the tools
      with our build system to prevent regressions and new bugs, and
      later used their profiling output to identify and fix new code
      that had caused performance regressions.

      Delivered live biweekly presentations to the entire company on the
      System Reliability Team's efforts, and was frequently voted
      the company's most popular and effective technical presenter.

      Also wrote the company's official Python style guide.

  Chief Dev Lunch Officer:
    Employer: Boston-area startup

      mantle after just a few weeks on the job. Responsibilities
      included organizing biweekly lunch meetings of the entire
      engineering team, finding relevant and fun technical topics to
      discuss, and coaching colleagues in group presentation-making.

      Leveraged the role to break down social barriers, encourage
      inter-team communication, and stimulate a culture of enthusiasm
      for learning.

  Software Engineer:
    Employer: Boston-area startup
    Dates: Oct 2014-Oct 2015
    Location: Cambridge, MA
    Description:
      Developed business analytics reports calculating metrics such as
      customer lifetime value, churn rate, and sales forecasting, and
      worked closely with product managers to develop a new set of
      reports for analyzing customer service response.

      Celebrated many code and query optimization achievements,
      including an 8x speedup on one report by eliminating redundant
      calculations.

    Comment:
      Realized after three semesters that computer architecture was not
      at all what I wanted to pursue with my career. Took a semester off
      to see how I liked software development, and never looked back.
